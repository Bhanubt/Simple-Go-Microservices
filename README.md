# Microservices Project with Golang

This project demonstrates a microservices architecture using Golang. The system comprises three independent services that can interact with each other: Admin, Client, and Employee.

## Microservices Overview

### 1. Admin Microservice
- **Port:** 8080
- **Description:** Handles administrative tasks and provides interfaces for managing the system.

### 2. Client Microservice
- **Port:** 8081
- **Description:** Client has permission to only view the profile.

### 3. Employee Microservice
- **Port:** 8082
- **Description:** Employee has permission to only view the profile.

## Interaction and Independence

Each microservice is designed to run independently, ensuring modularity and scalability. They communicate with each other via RESTful APIs, allowing for seamless data exchange and coordinated operations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go (version 1.16 or later)
- SQLite (in-built for database management)
